# My-Portfolio-Website
This is my portfolio website to add all of my work to showcase it.

## Description

The website is to showcase my work that I have made and to allow people to visit the website and click on the links directing to the work I have put online. It's used to give out my contact info, if anyone is looking to talk to me.
